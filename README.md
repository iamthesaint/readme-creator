## Description
Every project is unique to its developer. Even if the idea has been created before, each contributor adds their distinctive features and styles. README files are one of the first files someone sees when visiting a project repository, and should be inviting to potential users, fellow developers, students, and curious minds alike. As a descriptive outline of your app, it allows the viewer to choose to use or clone your repo, and should provide enough information for everyone to understand how your project works and what it accomplishes. README Creator allows the user to dynamically generate a detailed, formatted README.md file from the command line for their repository using Node.js. Because this file is such a critical part of any project, it requires the developer to thoughtfully outline the importance of their project and convey to the potential user how it is able to assist them with solving a problem. README Creator asks specific questions and dynamically populates a completely formatted Markdown file with the users answers, allowing the developer to spend more time in the coding process and less time writing a README from scratch.
